Simple iterative solution
Alternating between the smallest and the next-smallest disks, follow the steps for the appropriate case:


For an even number of disks:

make the legal move between pegs A and B
make the legal move between pegs A and C
make the legal move between pegs B and C
repeat until complete


For an odd number of disks:

make the legal move between pegs A and C
make the legal move between pegs A and B
make the legal move between pegs C and B
repeat until complete


In each case, a total of (2^n)-1 moves are made.
