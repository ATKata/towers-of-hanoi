The requirements of the game are as follows:

1) The puzzle starts with all the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one peg, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

2) Only one disk can be moved at a time.

3) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.

4) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Hint the perfect solution involves (2^n)-1 moves where n is the number of disks.
